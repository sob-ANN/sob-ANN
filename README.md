    <h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Soban Lone</h1>
    <h3>PhD Candidate at TUM. </h3>

Iâ€™m currently working on **Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Predictions**

In my master's (at IIT Delhi), I worked on **generalized variational Bayesian inference of Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) for surrogate modelling of partial differential equations.**

I host my projects [here](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Projects). If interested, please have a look. Always open to suggestions.
